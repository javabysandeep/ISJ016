Types of stream based on the type of data that we carry
	- Byte oriented streams
		○ These stream carries the bytes
		○ To represent byte oriented streams we have set of classes
			§ InputStream(AC)
				□ FileInputStream(CC) ---> to read bytes from the file
				□ BufferedInputStream(CC) ---> to read bytes from the Buffer
				□ ObjectInputStream(CC)---> to read object from the file
			§ OutputStream(AC)
				□ FileOutputStream(CC) ---> to write bytes to the file
				□ BufferedOutputStream(CC) ---> to write bytes to the Buffer
				□ ObjectOutputStream(CC))---> to write object to the file

	- Character oriented streams
		○ These stream carries the character
		○ To represent character oriented streams we have set of classes
			§ Reader(AC)
				□ FileReader(CC) ---> read characters from the file
				□ BufferedReader(CC)---> read characters from the buffer
			§ Writer(AC)
				□ FileWriter(CC) ---> write characters to the file
				□ BufferedWriter(CC)---> write characters to the buffer
